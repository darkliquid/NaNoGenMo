Title: Darkliquid's Random Writing Prompts

Description: If you just look at my track record on here, you'll see I'm terrible at finishing anything. I tend to generate ideas pretty rapidly though, so if you happen to subscribe to my particular brand of crazy, here are some writing prompts for you.


Chapter 1: Darkliquid's Random Writing Prompts

Welcome, one and all, to my random writing prompts, but first an introduction!

Hello, I'm darkliquid and I am a spinner of tales unfinished. I have the bad habit of starting stories and never finishing them. However, I love coming up with new ideas and tend to have them on a fairly regular basis. Sometimes ideas are just story fragments. Sometimes concepts. Sometimes pieces of dialogue, quotes, monologues or other random flotsam and jetsam floating around in my brain. Whatever the idea is, under my stewardship it's nigh on guaranteed to remain unfinished, relegated to the annals of protagonize as one of the many orphans looking for new authors to make them whole.

So, I've decided to stop kidding myself. Each page of this work will be a different writing prompt, be it an entire page or a short fragment with some accompanying thoughts and ideas. I'm licensing everything under an Attribution only license, meaning you can do anything with any of the prompts herein, be it a derivative work (the obvious usage) or a commercial use as long as you provide attribution. Also, you're under no obligation to republish your own works based of any of these prompts as Creative Commons work. You can do whatever you please as long as you provide attribution back to me for the inspiration that set you on your path. Obviously, I'd encourage using a CC license, but it isn't mandatory.

If you do use one of these prompt to create a new work or to add to an existing one, do let me know and I'll mention it in the authors guidance or something like that, as well as get warm fuzzy feelings inside from knowing I helped in inspire someone.

So without further delay, let the brain-farting begin!

Chapter 2: Prompt 1: Dialogue fragment, violence, insults

"I gonna punch you in the face so hard you'll be #!@%ing fists!"

I'm hearing this said in my head in a southern American country-hick stereotype drawl.

As an opening line, it sets the scene quite well for violence and gives some fairly colourful personality behind the speaker and has a slight hint at humour if you find these kind of elaborate insult/threats amusing like I do.

I see the line being said to the protagonist, rather than by them and along that train of thought I imagine the protagonist responding defensively rather aggressively, trying to calm the person down. What did our protagonist do to warrant such a threat? Did they steal something from our antagonist, insult them in some way prior to the opening scene?

Alternatively, I quite like the idea of the protagonist responding in a wise-ass kind of way, a sort of "Surely I'd just be
#!@%
ing just one fist, unless you plan on punching me with both hands, in which case you might as well just dive in my mouth you inbred retard."

Chapter 3: Prompt 2: Concept, speculative.

In the future technology reaches the point where human mind emulation and upload becomes possible. However, it becomes clear that the human mind and psychological state is tied inexorably to the physical world and physical experience. Human minds in a pure mental state go insane and need the constant stimulus of real-world interaction that only existing in a physical world can bring.

Human minds can't be downloaded into flesh as the structure of the brain and the technology to actually build one from scratch that will represent the mind doesn't yet exist, so life after death or body transferral Â doesn't exist. However, a new kind of technology presents itself.

Hitch-hikers. Minds without a body that hitch-hike on other, real people's, real world experience as their actions and stimuli are copied and streamed to the eager, hungry digital minds. Hitch-hikers get to live other people's lives as a passive observer while having their minds free to do other things. Obviously someone else's entire sensorium is quite distracting, not to mention the obvious privacy concerns, so the visual and auditory senses are disabled.

Meat-space people can sell their sensoriums as subscription services to digital minds and minds can subscribe to more than one, switching between sensoriums at will. Hitch-hikers can experience the life of a child, the opposite gender, a dying person. Sensorium pornography becomes huge.

Publicly licensed sensorium feeds are anonymised so the subscribers can't find out who they are subscribed to but ones contracted privately are bound by no such restriction.

Story ideas for this include privacy concerns, body-hijacking, the effect of the dead still living digitally as parasites on the living on society, what happens when a mind falls in love with the person they are subscribed to? Lots of various things can be done with this and you've got a good "two different worlds" motif going on with the digital, mental-only world of the hitch-hikers and the physical world and how denizens of both interact.

Chapter 4: Prompt 3: Concept, speculative, social

What if a virus rendered the entire population of earth simultaneously immortal and sterile except for a single small town (that have barely enough population to be genetically viable for continuing the species)?

Things that could happen include:

dying made illegal

forced breeding camps

small town suddenly a major political power

children becoming a prized resource and kidnapped, etc by other countries

racial issues

pressure on gays/lesbians in town

effects of immortality on politics, economy, property law, etc.

elitism and self-preservation and the conflict between immortals and mortals.

discovering cause of virus (terrorism/accident/aliens/god/whatever) and why.

why was this one town immune? Can a cure be found from studying them and is a cure even desired?

Chapter 5: Prompt 4: Title and blurb; technical, biological, philosophical

Title: Meta-life

Everything can be reduced down to simpler components and likewise, complexity can emerge from the multitude of simple interactions between simple system. Chemistry emerges from the interaction of sub-atomic particles. Biology emerges from the interaction of semi-self-sustaining chemical reactions. Complex life forms emerge from the interaction between simple single cells. Human consciousness emerges from the interactions and between millions of neurons sending chemical and electrical messages.

There are billions of human beings on Earth, interacting with each other in millions of ways, at different rates. Telecommunications has bought everyone closer together, made every interaction ripple that much more throughout the whole world. Information exchanges hands financially, electronically, audibly. People live, die and the ripples spread on in complex patterns invisible to the individual.

But what happens when life begins to emerge from these components. A meta-life-form whose organs are cities and data exchanges, whose mind runs on a substrate of human interaction itself, whose flesh is a hybrid of concrete, steel and human beings. Just as a human being isn't aware of each individual cell in their bodies, nor is this meta-life aware of us, but then again, a single cell isn't a sentient being and if they were, what would they have to say to the bodies they make up?

What are the dangers of such an interaction taking place? A rat, given a button that directly stimulates it's pleasure centres, starves to death, pressing the button till it's last moment. Would this meta-life-form do the same, and if it dies, what does that mean for humanity?

Humanity is waking up.

* * * * *

Lots of fun ideas for this. Conspiracy theories of people trying to control the meta-beast for their own ends, people trying to communicate with it or accidentally discovering it. Possible alien involvement - what happens when the beast wants to mate, what kind of time scales does it operate over - a human refreshes every cell over 7 years buts lives on average 80. Is a basic cellular refresh an 80 year cycle for it? Is there more than one, existing across geographical, economic and digital boundaries? Are any even intelligent yet or are they merely the meta-equivalent of single cellular creatures or something more? Lots of fun questions to explore, I think a strong usage of biological analogy taken literally is appropriate - say we go down the conspiracy route, someone is looking into alien cover-ups and finds that they've happened, but more by accident than anything else. There is no government conspiracy, it's larger and less centralised than that. It's almost like society has some kind of immuno-response to aliens on a social level... Or some kind of economic collapse can be expressed as some kind of cancer or wasting disease of the meta-life-form when remapped into a meta-biological framework. That kind of thing.

Chapter 6: Prompt 5: Concept, fantasy, scifi

A group of famous heroes/adventurers are summoned before a great council of races and charged with a mission of almighty importance. The entire world is under threat Outsiders, creatures from beyond the Outer Gates, beyond the realms of mortal reality are trying to consume the world. The heroes gave saved the world time and again and so the council charge them to do it again and the heroes accept.

Thus starts an epic adventure to discover the cause and source of the Outsiders and to find a way to stop them.

However, the twist is that the Outsiders are no Outsiders at all. They are a games development company and their developers/designers/writers are coming up with a world identical to theirs. The Multiverse is awash with universes born from every whim of imagination that will ever be but there can only ever be one of each, so when the actions of the games company converge with the reality of the heroes universe, strange things start to happen.

Slowly their world is being transformed to obey the rules designed by the game designers but also the developers see weird bugs and code fragments appearing, strange bodies of code and weird events on their servers they never designed whilst they are building their product.

Eventually, the heroes becomes aware of the Outsiders and a game designer becomes aware of the reality they are co-opting for their own profit. Together they work to save their world.

Lots of possibilities for romance, adventure, office politics, corporate sabotage. Two worlds clash, etc. The effects on countless cultures by artificial rules designed to enhance players fun becoming like laws of physics.

Perhaps the game designer originally designed the world exactly as theirs but as changes came down from management and focus groups to increase fun and monetisation the 'real' world began to suffer. Game designer perhaps needs to drastically change the game design so much it severs the two worlds and allows them to co-exist, but he'll never see/hear from the people of that world again (maybe he falls in love with one, manages to go there as an in-game Outsider bad-guy faction person).

Fun stuff!

Chapter 7: Prompt 6: Concept, comedy, diary

A young person decides they want to become a super-villain. However, it's not as easy as it appears to be in the comic books.

There are no volcano-lairs for sale and even if there were, how the hell does anyone ever afford one? The logistics alone are staggering. The legal issues nigh-on insurmountable. Ridiculous amounts of money would be needed to fund everything, not to mention henchmen and henchwomen. How would you even hire them, what about labour laws? What about actually carrying out any real villainy? The government would have the authorities or even the army down on you for a national event, the world for an international one - how could one person succeed in that?

The story follows the diary of a young person as they attempt to over come these odds and solve these problems in the real world where super-heroes and super-villains don't exist and falling in toxic waste just kills you instead of giving you super powers.

Lots of fun stuff to play with such as young-person naivety, coming-of-age, dealing with real world responsibility. Compromise. Sulking. Lucky breaks and nasty set-backs.Â 

Chapter 8: Prompt 7: Concept, children's story, travel

A young girl desperately wants to go on holiday somewhere but her family is poor and can't afford it. In an act of naievity and desperation, she spends all her money on stamps and posts herself to her destination through the postal system which is much cheaper.

However, it turns out the postal system is much more complex than she ever imagined and her package gets Lost. She ends up in a world of constant messages and parcels being sent every which way. Within she meets the Lost, others that have travelled through system and got stuck and survive by poaching food parcels. There are stories of people how have escaped the postal system, that vast catacombs of treadmills, scanning machines, parcel shoots, but no-one has ever returned to tell them they've been successful.

The girl has an adventure in the odd, unnatural realm of the Post and together with her new found friends journeys to find a way out, whilst avoiding the darker, nastier denizens of that hidden realm.

Chapter 9: Prompt 8: concept, title, kafka-esque psychological thriller office drama

Title:
Cubicle 14

Steven is desperate for a new job, so when he finally lands a random data entry position at some faceless firm he has never heard of, he jumps at the opportunity.

However, when he arrives and is assigned to cubicle fourteen, he is given a sheet of meaningless numbers and an ancient computer and left to his own devices. He nevers sees the managers, but hears them through the intercoms, he has no guidance on what to do for his job whatsoever and every question he asks is batted away due to his colleagues being either busy or answering him with evasive, well-meaning but ultimately useless answers. The office environment descends into an almost feral battle for survival against confusion, self-doubt, office politics, the fear of an unknowable but absolute authority and the realisation that Steven hasn't been home at all since he started or at least, he can no longer remember leaving...

Chapter 10: Prompt 9: concept, fantasy

A farm girl volunteers to join the militia when the Kingdom sends out a call to arms to help it stand against an approaching evil. The militia, led by a band of renown heroes face up against the evil forces but are defeated. In the struggle, the farm girl picks up a sword of one of the fallen heroes before fleeing with her family to a neighbouring kingdom.

As it turns out, the sword is a magical, intelligent item. Unfortunately, it is also cursed. Whomever picks up the sword is magically welded to it forever and can never let it go for any reason. The sword is a grumpy, sarcastic and somewhat bitter entity and becomes the girls mentor, trying to train her to be decent warrior, but she wants none of it and just wants to avoid the evil forces and keep her family safe, especially after the slaughter she saw during her term in the militia.

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. The invasion was a ruse to draw out the heroes. The leader of the evil forces wants the sword because it's an ancient artefact and has been privy to secrets long since forgotten that this leader wants. Secrets that could give the leader far more power than the mere control of a single army and rule of a single kingdom. The leader is hunting for the sword and so no matter where she runs, the farm girl will always be in the leader's sights until either they get the sword or she dies and it is claimed by someone else.

The story that follows is the tale of a reluctant heroine thrust into a situation she has no control over by the cruel circumstances of fate, egged on by a sarcastic, grumpy mentor.

Ideas for scenes could include:

The sword deliberately trying to get her killed by a better, more worthy person of the sword so it has a better chance.

Getting into bad situations because she can't hide/drop her weapon.

Chapter 11: Prompt 10, blurb; music, sci-fi, thriller

A biomusicologist researching psychoacoustic techniques for helping coma victims is almost killed when the lab he works in is attacked after he discovers some disturbing trends in his research.

He survives, but is left partially deaf. He can no longer perform his research as effectively (what with most of it being stolen and his lack of hearing) so the company he worked for lays him off.

Then, he starts seeing evidence of his research being used in the media. Through his lost studies, he had discovered something he called harmonic limbic resonance and that, while complicated beyond anyone's ability to create, music could be created that directly targeted specific areas of the human nervous system, creating emotional states, effecting memory, even stopping autonomic system like the heart beat. It was a deep area of study on his way to finding a music-based therapy for coma victims but now it seemed it was being used by whomever had stolen it for nefarious ends.

As dark forces start taking over the country, he is the only one that can stop the it.

It's time to face the music.

Notes:

Fun stuff to do with corporate espionage, spies, murder and assassination. Evil bad guys, world domination, etc all on the cards, though perhaps something more sane and low-key, like manipulating people en masse Â for personal gain and profit. Morality, disability and music are all strong themes, as is revenge, music-science and of course comas. Lots of fun ideas to play with.

Chapter 12: Prompt 11, concept, bio-punk, dystopian

Recombinant genetics and bio-engineering are household terms. Every house has a splicer and an artificial womb. As resources depleted and we started hitting the upper limits of what we could achieve with technology we turned back to nature, millions of years worth of development, and repurposed it for our own use.

Nanotech was bunk, we just couldn't make artificial constructs detailed and clever enough to do what nature had already achieved with viruses and bacteria millennia ago.

Bio-hacking is the next big thing, gone are the electronic glows of computer screens on the faces of geeks everywhere to be replaced with the glows of protein sequencers and gene splicers. The computer age has come and gone. Now its the genetic age and already its achieved what technology was only barely struggling to do. It got inside you, inside everyone. Artificially enhanced muscles, retroviral cosmetic treatments, toggleable savantism. Its not just what's inside though, architecture soars in once impossible forms made from spiders silk grown in bio-farms by fields of targetted bacterium. Streets kept clean by customized reptiles that hoard them into the dark places beneath cities where the trash is digested by tailored organisms into useful products in industry. Mobile homes in the interior cavities of colossal, engineered woodlouse roam the countryside, self-sufficient nomads.

Its a golden age, or at least it was until the infection came. Nobody knows how, it shouldn't have even been possible with the huge numbers of regulatory viruses and gene sequences in place but somehow the world got cancer and not the kind that's been wiped out for generations. They call themselves the Malignancy, a race of sentient tumors that consume everything in their path. No one knows where they came from or who made them but they are here and the world is in an eternal arms race against them, trying drugs, viruses, nukes, anything to cull the spread. Every city is a quarantine zone, every living thing a suspect, a carrier, a vector for the Malignancy to worm their way in to the barricaded biospheres that hide behind glass domes or nuclear fallout.

The biotech companies are in control now.Â  They hold the gun to your head and the keys to the cities. Protectors, tyrants, murderers, saviours, thieves, the companies run this world now and if you don't like it, you can try your luck outside with the Malignancy and see how they treat you. The companies exist in constant battle, stealing each others secrets whilst coveting their own, each wanting to be the saviour but none wanting to give up the privilege and power they have.

Jobs still need doing, people need killing, genes need stealing. Somethings gotta pay the bills, you might as well let a company foot the bill.

The night's young, and you could kill for some credits.Â 

Chapter 13: Prompt 12: title and concept, chick-lit, drama, romantic-comedy

Title:
Deep Fillings

Jennifer has finally made it and achieved her dream - she managed to open her own sandwich shop. However, things aren't quite as peachy as she'd imagined. She could only afford a place in a bad part of town and another sandwich shop two blocks over seems to have it in for her. Sales aren't going as well as hoped, even when she makes the best sandwiches this side of the city.

When she befriends a local prostitute and the local pimp starts getting rough with his girls, Jennifer has an idea to open the first sandwich shop/bordello, to draw in more customers for both her and the prostitutes and to provide them all with a safe place to operate and when things get busy, the girls even help out in the shop.

Soon her store becomes more popular than she imagined as word spreads, but nothing is ever easy. The pimp wants his girls back and Crusty's declares all out war and isn't afraid to fight dirty - not to mention trying to balance relationships with being a madam and running a sandwich shop!

Chapter 14: Prompt 13: title/concept, horror

Title:
Â Train

Jason is a hard worker, he does a long commute everyday and sinks almost half of his earnings into the cost of his commute, a journey that adds almost a full six hours to his work day every day. It's tough, but he does it anyway. In this economy, he can't afford not to. However, he is finally taking some well earned and most needed holiday and is taking the journey home on the train back home where he will get to spend a glorious two weeks work free with his wife and son.

However, Jason falls asleep on the train and when he wakes up, he finds he's still on it, but something is wrong. The signs show nothing. Every advertisement is a blank sheet, colours seem muted, grey but worst of all are his fellow passengers. They are all asleep, or so it seems until he reaches out to touch one of them and they crumble as if made of dust. Outside the train is perfect blackness, no lights of any kind, not even moonlight. Everything is eerily silent except for the rhythmic pulse of the train as it passes over each rail.

Jason needs to find out what is going on. Something tells him he doesn't want to be on the train when it reaches it's destination but equally, something tells him that the darkness outside could be something much worse.

Much, much worse.

Chapter 15: Prompt 14: title/concept, horror, fantasy

Title:
Reunion

Kal Malik was the most feared sorcerer of the Outer Kingdoms, he began his life as a healer, a follower of the god Hath, the keeper of the body and champion of wholeness and unity. Something turned in him though, something changed and his faith took on a darker path. As the years passed, he reigned a war of terror across the kingdoms in his mad quest for the unity, to become on earth as Hath was himself upon the mountains of the heavens. Dragging man, woman and child from their beds and fusing them into him, a twisted being of mangled flesh, growing ever larger. Fuelled by the souls of his victims, he grew ever larger and more powerful, his fleshsmithing knew no equal, no opponent could stand against him.

Seeing that they would fall to the same fate if they did not intervene, the denizens of the Inner Kingdoms rose up to smite him down. It took almost two centuries of war, fighting against the Collossus, as they called him in the Inner tongue, before he was finally defeated. The next twenty years the best practitioners of the Collegiate worked upon his corpse to free his victims who, even in their hosts death, were still very much alive, trapped in a maze of flesh and madness. Eventually, with the help of their strange machines and ungodly magicks, they were all freed and returned to their homelands, but much had changed in two centuries and most were shunned, feared they would turn against them, that they were forever tainted by the foul union Malik had inflicted upon them.

Hath's name became hated, Kal's madness poisoning his name to all but the most devout priests who were driven out by the common folk.

When their work was done, those of the Inner Kingdom left, sealing the gates to the Outer kingdom behind them. They did not like to be interfered with by the lower people and with the threat erased, they left again behind their walls, to do whatever it was they did in their secret place.

Jen is one of the Separated. One of the early victims, two whole centuries have passed. Everyone he ever knew or loved is dead and those that know of his past shun him, afraid of what he might become.

However, he has made a life for himself on the furthest reaches of the Outer Kingdoms. He has taken a wife, raised three beautiful children and the town folk are none the wiser to his past. It's as perfect as it can be, after what he went through, but now something is happening.

He has an urge to be somewhere, a feeling he has to meet people, that others are waiting for him from his past. He feels it coming, the urge gnawing in his brain like a starving rat. A reunion. The Separated are coming together, drawn by something far older than Kal, something in the blood, something in the head and the heart.

Jen has a life now and he can't give it up, he wont, not for this, not to start the cycle of horror all over again. His only chance to keep his new life is to journey across the Outer Kingdoms with his family and seek help beyond the Inner gates.

But no-one has ever crossed from the Outer to the Inner kingdoms and the doors have never opened again since they closed all those years ago. But the denizens of the Inner Kingdoms, they are the only ones that can help him, if anyone can. Jen must journey beyond the wall, before he finds himself at a reunion that could herald the end of everything.

Chapter 16: Prompt 15: concept, science-fiction

Originally a plan for an entry for the Machine of Death anthology.

A way is discovered to determine the fate of anyone. However, it's painfully vague at times, the mode of death oft described in no more than 2 or 3 words. However, with inevitability, comes a new weapon. If you know how someone is going to die, you can use that as an advantage.Â 

People with highly unlikely, extremely specific or otherwise impossible deaths get recruited and trained as super-soldiers, since they are almost guaranteed not to die. High casualty, collateral damage-causing deaths are deployed like suicide bombers, banned from being near a nations own assets and sent to live in strategic targets ni enemy territories.

Lots of ideas here, how to cheat fate being a prime example, the social ramifications of this, etc.

Chapter 17: Prompt 16: concept; science-fiction, time-travel, tourism

A simplistic form of time-travel is invented that allows you to swap bodies with your past or future self temporarily, but only when both parties agree. As such, you can't travel into a past self before you became aware of the technology, before it existed or before the first time you agreed to trade some present time for some time in the future. There are other limitations, such as you can only trade places with a future self that occurs after the last future self you traded with (so if you trade places with yourself in ten years, you can't later than trade places without yourself 5 years from now but you can trade places with yourself 11 years from now). The reason for this is obvious - you can't travel to the past of a known future because then you could change the past of a future you that is known to exist and destroy them (by example jumping into a future before them and killing yourself) which would break the continuum. However, there isn't any risk of a future self killing themselves in their own past to destroy themselves because while they are in the past, their present essentially doesn't exist yet and the actions taken in the present only lock in the inevitability of their existence when they swap back, so the continuum can essentially white wash it as a suicide in the present rather than a self-murder from the future. You also can't jump to the same future or past twice, it's a one time only usage.

The continuum is fairly self-regulating though and so seemingly obvious abuses such as trading stocks when you know the outcome are self-regulating with a sort of future-past-future feedback loop that rounds things out as the information flows forward back and forward again in an endless cycle.

Lots of interesting things such as people not being able to jump to their future selves and wondering why don't agree to it in the future or if they got killed or otherwise made unable to jump back. People chrono-touristing back to earlier lives to spend time with friends that were killed.

Think of the concept as a bizarre two-way version of the phenomenon in the film "The Butterfly Effect" but with more rules and tourism mixed in.

Chapter 18: Prompt 17: concept; thriller, comedy, religion, conspiracy

There have been many predictions about the second coming of Christ but none of them have happened yet. Or perhaps, it did happen and it was covered up.

Angelvine Vineyards is the largest, most successful producer of wine in the world. Their products are everywhere and universally the receive perfect reviews from all connoisseurs of wine across the globe. In the industry their power is absolute and their profits huge - for a privately owned company their scope and influence is unmatched.

However, Angelvine's shadowy cabal of directors have a dark secret. Christ did return to Earth back in 1982 and for the last 30 years, Angelvine has kept him secret from the world, locked away and forced to turn water into wine for them for their own selfish profit and denied the chance to bring about a new age for mankind.

Now, their secret is about to come out. Disgraced wine critic and historian Marshal Defoe has been looking into Angelvine for some time, trying to find a reason for their 'too-good-to-be-true' success. One day, he is contacted by a priest of a secretive order. Through the miracle of transubstantiation, they have discovered a message hidden in a bottle of Angelvine communion wine, a clue that points to something strange going on within the company, the church and an ancient prophecy about the end of the world.

Is this just the chance Marshal needs to finally regain the respect he lost to his obsession with taking down Angelvine? Together Marshal and the church work to solve the mystery, save the world and, most importantly, once and for all prove that Marshal's opinion that Angelvine's wines really aren't all that great isn't as mad as the industry says it is.

Yes, this is clearly a parody of the Da Vinci code, et al in several respects.

Chapter 19: Prompt 18; prophecy, dreams, horror, plot fragment

Alex is standing on a train station platform, waiting for a train. A train goes through, non-stopping. People start moving towards the platform edge, walk right into side of moving train. Alex panics, tries to get help but people are now crowding behind him, all pushing towards the speeding train. Alex tries to resist, fight, but he can't and gets pushed into the train, his skull smashed, flesh torn, screaming agony as he is rammed against the side of the speeding train.

Cut scene to yelling. Being dragged away from a person being operated on in a hospital operating room.

"Is he alright?"

"Alex are you okay?"

"Get him out of the operating room! Now! Jesus! We're losing the patient!"

Cut to admin office. Sat at desk opposite hospital administrator.

"What the hell happened back there Alex? You're lucky the patient was a John Doe, otherwise we could be in a crapstorm right now. I'm suspending your license pending full investigation and ordering you to see a therapist."

Cut to 2 years later. Lost job, incident covered up to protect the hospital's reputation. Alex is working on the docks as a labourer. He catches the train home. Things look familiar somehow, then it starts happening, the hallucinations that got him fired and killed a patient become real. As he is about to be pushed into the train, someone grabs Alex, pulls him up into a ceiling vent.

Chapter 20: Prompt 19: superheroes, addiction, morality, concept

Superheroes are real. There seems to be some kind of virus going around that grants people super powers. At first, its great, crime nose dives and society flourishes but soon it becomes clear that the superheroes have an addiction to saving people, the virus causing them to become adrenaline fuelled praise-junkies always in need of another high.

Some even start engineering crimes just so they can stop them, funnelling their wealth back into crime just to feed their addiction, but it becomes obvious to society that S3 or Superhero Satisfaction Syndrome is becoming a real problem and needs to be stopped. Superheroes are tightly controlled by the government and kept in rehab camps, carefully monitored. Newly created heroes that haven't yet been consumed by the addiction are allowed to operate under strict supervision and often work as guards for the ageing populace of junkie heroes, making sure they don't break out and cause havok.
