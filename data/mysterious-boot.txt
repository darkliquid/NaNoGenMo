Title: Mysterious Boot

Description: A song that randomly popped into my head when I saw a lone boot abandoned outside the train station on my way home from work.


Chapter 1: Mysterious Boot

I see you standing

there on the sidewalk

all alone without your twin


You're covered with dirt

and smell like old cheese

and I wonder where you've been


[chorus]

Mysterious welly, mysterious boot

do you know where you belong?

mysterious welly, mysterious boot

has your journey been hard and long?

In this world where we all walk

Down a winding garden path

There's a place I want go

My dirty, plastic friend

[/chorus]


On which foot did you fit?

Who did you carry there

to the place you lay abandoned?

Did your wearer even care?

Just a boot without a twin

why do you matter so much to me?

For a man without a friend

you could be a perfect fit


Even though your journey's done

and your brother is elsewhere

even dirty and alone

know I care, know I care


[chorus repeats]
